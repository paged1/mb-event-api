# Manitoba Events API

## Description

Manitoba Events API is an event registry that makes it easy to access and share details for upcoming events. Providing a single source to all local events, this API removes the hassle of scouring each venue's website or scouting for lesser known and more specialized events. Manitoba Events API also benefits business owners by extending their reach and increasing visibility in relevant searches and advertising.
